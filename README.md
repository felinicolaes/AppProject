Food waste is currently a big problem in the world. The average Dutch person throws away 50 kilos (150 euros or 14 procent of our bought food) in food every year.

> This app is more than your average recipe book: it will make it possible to enter ingredients you want to use this day and will search for added recipes with these ingredients.


All the recipes have to be added yourself, because people generally already have a lot of recipes they enjoy cooking and making recipes they already know they'll like. The adding of new recipes will be made as easy to use as possible.

The ingredients have to be typed by hand, but instead of typing out the whole recipe, a picture of the recipe will suffice. This will make the process of adding new recipes a lot easier. Pictures of the finished dish can also be added.

An example of a recipe can be:<br />
<b>Spanish Tortilla</b> <br />
- 3 egg  <br />
- 2 potatoe <br />
- 1 garlic clove <br />
- salt <br />
- oil <br />
- (onion) <br />
- broccoli OR green beans OR salad <br />

This means that to make this recipe, you will at least need 3 eggs, 2 potatoes, 1 garlic clove, salt and oil. The ingredient between brackets is optional: you can add this if you have it, but don't have to.
The last item includes the OR, this means you can add broccoli or green beans or salad, depending on what you have. Based on the ingredients you have, the app will also be able to make a grocery list, so it will be even easier to go out to the shop to buy what you don't have at home yet.
