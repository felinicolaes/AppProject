## Empty Your Fridge

---------------------

    Start with a short description of your application (like in the README.md).

    Clearly describe the technical design: how does your code map to the functionality? (like in the DESIGN.md but updated!)

    Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document (from the PROCESS.md).

    Defend these decisions by writing a brief argument (single paragraph). Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs for your current solution?

    Make sure the document is complete and reflects the final state of the application. The document will be an important part of your grade.
